summary:     os: add Chtimes function
</pre>
<p><b>Me:</b> "how to portably use syscall.Utimes for the Timeval size
      differences on amd64 vs 386?  Can't figure out how to do a cast
      that depends on the Timeval.Sec size type"<p>

<p><b>Russ:</b> "Basically nothing in syscall can be used portably. There
      should be a wrapper in package os but no one has written it
      yet. "
