Was wondering if you could help me debug/profile my "gotsync" program
sometime today or this week.  I'm trying to sync the Android tree to
an NFS server here but it works sometimes, hangs sometimes, crashes
sometimes.  And when it does run, uses a ton of CPU.  And it doesn't
seem to work under 6prof....
