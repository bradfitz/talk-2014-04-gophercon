You know of any Go packages (I'm not seeing any?) for doing PKCS#7 / CMS signing stuff?<br>
<br>
How hard would it be to create GnuPG detached signatures without shelling out to gpg?  Alternatively, at least parsing the resultant pk7(?) detached signature files and getting out the raw numbers for serialization in another format?<br>
<br>
Any pointers appreciated, thanks!
